                            You must be at least 17 years old to donate to the general blood supply, or 16 years old with parental/guardian consent, 
                            if allowed by state law. There is no upper age limit for

                            <p>Those younger than age 17 are almost always legal minors (not yet of the age of majority) who cannot give consent by themselves to donate blood.
                             (Each state determines its own age of majority, which can be different for different activities.)
                             Persons under the age of 17 may, however, donate blood for their own use,
                            in advance of scheduled surgery or in situations where their blood has special medical value for a particular patient such as a family member.</p>

                            If you are on aspirin, it is OK to donate whole blood.
                             However, you must be off of aspirin for at least 2 full days in order to donate platelets by apheresis.
                              For example, if you take aspirin products on Monday, the soonest you may donate platelets is Thursday.
                               Donors with clotting disorder from Factor V who are not on anticoagulants are eligible to donate; 
                               however, all others must be evaluated by the health historian at the collection center.
